# Genomics Internship at The EVERY Company: R-Shiny Project

Engineered an R Shiny application that incorporates an array of bioinformatics, statistics, and data visualization principles. 
Developed a complex R Shiny pipeline that: took a user’s desired gene list and cross referenced it with a database of the company’s species of focus that included a comprehensive list of genes and corresponding annotation terms (GO, KEGG, INTERPRO, etc.), performed the Fisher’s Exact Test on each matching annotation term and produced a downloadable file with each term’s p-value, and finally visualized each annotation term and its p-value with an interactive heatmap. 
-Utilized R Studio in order to filter large datasets based on desired criteria. Frequently utilized R Studio packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, and dplyr in order to filter and visualize large datasets. 
-Performed DNA Sequencing. 
-Performed DNA Annotation using SnapGene.
